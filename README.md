# Train-Arrivals
this project is about train arrivals and minutes away, you enter some information about the train you want to add like a train name, destination, first departure and frequency (min, the time between two trains), and the program will calculate the time the next train will arrive and minutes away.

i used google firebase to store the trains data and moment.js to calculate the time and minutes away.
